/**
 * x402 v2, in CoinPayPortal's dialect, plus the spec's transport headers.
 *
 * Checked against @profullstack/coinpay/x402-v2 rather than remembered: the 402
 * body is JSON `{ x402Version: 2, accepts: [...] }`, the proof arrives as base64
 * JSON, and CoinPay's /api/x402/verify then /api/x402/settle do the
 * cryptography and the on-chain transfer (EIP-3009, with CoinPay's relayer
 * paying the gas, so the buyer needs no ETH).
 *
 * The x402 v2 transport spec moves all three messages into headers:
 * `PAYMENT-REQUIRED` (the offer, base64 JSON) on the 402, `PAYMENT-SIGNATURE`
 * (the proof) on the retry, and `PAYMENT-RESPONSE` (the settlement) on the
 * 200. The gateway speaks both: the body and `X-PAYMENT` stay for the clients
 * that already pay this way, and the headers are there for spec-strict ones.
 *
 * Reimplemented here in a few dozen lines because the SDK also carries the
 * CLI's interactive-prompt dependency, which a web server has no business
 * installing, and because a gateway that runs at the edge cannot import node:.
 */

/**
 * The three things CoinPay can settle under the `exact` scheme. USDC only:
 * EIP-3009 is an ERC-20 extension, so native ETH cannot be paid this way.
 *
 * CAIP-2 network ids, 6-decimal amounts, and the token's own EIP-712 domain in
 * `extra`, which is not derivable from the contract and was read over JSON-RPC
 * once upstream: all three USDC deployments answer "USD Coin" / "2".
 *
 * Base first. Merchant order is the payer's preference order, and Base is where
 * the relayer's gas is cheapest.
 *
 * Why not more: CoinPay's v2 settle broadcasts `transferWithAuthorization`
 * only on chains its relayer has an RPC and a funded wallet for, which are
 * exactly 1, 137 and 8453, and USDC is the only EIP-3009 dollar token on them
 * (USDT has no EIP-3009). Advertising anything else would quote a payment
 * that verifies and then never settles. Buyers who want another coin, or
 * PayPal, use the hosted checkout on the sales page instead. The one
 * exception is XNO on Nano, which CoinPay settles by a node lookup rather
 * than a relayer, and which `buildOffer` adds only when given a Nano payee.
